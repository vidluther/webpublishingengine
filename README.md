# WebPublishingEngine.com

This is a satire site for a hosting company. It's built with Tailwind CSS and ChatGPT o1-preview. 

This is a joke site, don't sue me.

I'm just having fun with the whole Automattic and WP Engine Drama.. 

There's always two sides to every story.. I have my own opinion on this thing, but for my own sanity I'm not going to discuss it here.

## Claude

A Claude version of this site is available at https://webpublishingengine.com/claude.html

It's built using Claude, and here's the prompt I used:

```Build a simple static html website using Bootstrap (latest version) and HTML for the domain name WebPublishingEngine.com , make it look like a landing page that is a hosting company with pricing tables and some customer reviews, do not use the letters WP as a way to shorten the domain name. If someone clicks on any of the links, tell them that this site is satire, please don't sue me. Use the following as open graph tags <meta name="generator" content="WebPublishingEngine.com">
