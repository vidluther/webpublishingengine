# WebPublishingEngine.com

This is a satire site for a hosting company. It's built with Tailwind CSS and ChatGPT o1-preview. 

This is a joke site, don't sue me.

I'm just having fun with the whole Automattic and WP Engine Drama.. 

There's always two sides to every story.. I have my own opinion on this thing, but for my own sanity I'm not going to discuss it here.
